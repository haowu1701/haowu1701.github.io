My research focuses on semiparametric and causal inference methods, with emphasis on efficient influence functions, doubly robust estimation, and machine learning–assisted approaches. I study quantile-based causal estimands and robust inference under model misspecification and missing data.

### 📌 Semiparametric Theory
- Efficient influence functions (EIF)   
- Asymptotic variance estimation under model misspecification
- Double/debiased machine learning (DML)

### 📌 Causal Inference and Missing Data
- Doubly robust estimation  
- Quantile treatment effects (QTE)
- Probablity treatment effects (PTE)


### 📌 Others
- Cumulative probability models (CPM)
- Clustered randomized clinical trials (CRCT)
- High-dimensional confounding adjustment
- Longitudinal missingness


I am also broadly interested in applying modern causal inference tools to biomedical research, including HIV epidemiology, microbiome studies, and clinical outcome evaluation.
