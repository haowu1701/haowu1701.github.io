I am Hao Wu, a PhD student in the **Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University**. I am very grateful to be mentored by **Dr. Bryan E. Shepherd** and **Dr. Jinyuan Liu**. My current interests include:

### 📌 Semiparametric Theory
- Efficient influence functions (EIF)   
- Asymptotic variance estimation under model misspecification
- Double/debiased machine learning (DML)

### 📌 Causal Inference and Missing Data
- Doubly robust estimation  
- Quantile treatment effects (QTE)
- Longitudinal missingness

### 📌 Others
- Cumulative probability models (CPM)
- Clustered randomized clinical trials (CRCT)
- High-dimensional confounding adjustment


I am also broadly interested in applying modern causal inference tools to biomedical research, including HIV epidemiology, microbiome studies, and clinical outcome evaluation.
