I am Hao Wu, a PhD student in the **Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University**. I am very grateful to be mentored by **Dr. Bryan E. Shepherd** and **Dr.Jinyuan Liu**.

My methodological interests include:

### 📌 Causal Inference
- Doubly robust estimation  
- Quantile treatment effects  
- Semiparametric efficiency theory  
- Targeted learning and machine learning–based causal methods  

### 📌 Semiparametric Theory
- Efficient influence functions (EIF)  
- M-estimation and Z-estimation frameworks  
- Asymptotic variance estimation  
- Inference under model misspecification  

### 📌 Missing Data
- Missing not at random (MNAR) mechanisms  
- Longitudinal missingness  
- Sensitivity analysis  
- Causal inference with missing covariates and outcomes  

I am also broadly interested in applying modern causal inference tools to biomedical research, including HIV epidemiology, microbiome studies, and clinical outcome evaluation.

### 🎓 Background  
Before joining Vanderbilt, I completed my undergraduate training in **Bioinformatics**, where I cultivated a deep interest in combining data science with human health research. I later developed experience in longitudinal modeling, piecewise regression, and complex real-world data analysis through collaborations with clinical researchers.

At Vanderbilt, I continue to work on both statistical methodology and interdisciplinary collaborations, aiming to develop methods that are theoretically principled and practically useful.

### 🌱 Beyond Research  
Outside of academics, I enjoy science communication, cooking, and producing microbiology-themed educational content on Bilibili as **“胡萝卜不是菌”**.
