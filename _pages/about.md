I am Hao Wu, a PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University. I am very grateful to be mentored by **Dr. Bryan E. Shepherd** and **Dr. Jinyuan Liu**. My current research centers on causal inference and missing-data problems, with applications in HIV epidemiology, psychiatry, and clinical trials. More details can be found in the [Collaborative Research](research/) and [Methodology Research](Methodology/) sections.
